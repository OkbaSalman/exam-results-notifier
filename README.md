# exam-results-notifier
A Python script that periodically fetches student results from my university's website and sends updates to a Telegram channel.

## How It Works

- Fetches results by sending a POST request to the university's results page.
- Parses the HTML to extract relevant data.
- Detects changes and sends the updates to a Telegram channel.
